For companies with warehouses, **removal strategies** determine which products are taken from the
warehouse, and when. Removal strategies are typically defined for specific picking operations. This
helps companies to select the best products, optimize the distance workers need to travel when
picking items for orders, and account for quality control, such as moving products with expiration
dates.

Usually, *Removal Strategies* are defined in picking operations to select the best products to
optimize the distance for the worker, for quality control purposes, or to first move the products
with the closest expiration date.

I want to capture the removal strategies.

Similar to the :abbr:`FIFO (First In, First Out)` method, the :guilabel:`Last In, First Out (LIFO)`
removal strategy moves products based on the date they entered a warehouse's stock. Instead of
removing the oldest stock on-hand, however, it targets the **newest** stock on-hand for removal.

Every time an order for products with the :abbr:`LIFO (Last In, First Out)` method is placed, a
transfer is created for the lot/serial number that has most recently entered the stock (the **last**
lot/serial number that entered the warehouse's inventory).
