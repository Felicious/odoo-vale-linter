According to Wikipedia, the *World Health Organization* (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United
Nations that is concerned with international public health. We can now use :abbr:`WHO (World Health
Organization)` because it has been defined, but we can’t use :abbr:`DAFB (Da Amazing Face Book)`
because people may not know what it represents. We can use :abbr:`DAFB (Da Amazing Face Book)` when
it’s presented as code, though.
